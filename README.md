# Deepswap AI vs Facefusion: Which One Is Better for Face Swap
[Deepswap](https://www.deepswap.ai/) is a well-known website for swapping faces. Unlike other sites, it says it uses its own face swap technology instead of open source software. To be honest, if you compare some online face swap websites to open source software, you'll notice the face swap results are quite alike.
## Popular Open Source Software
With the open-sourcing of DeepFaceLab and FaceSwap in 2018, an increasing number of face-swapping software tools have been developed and made available as open-source projects. Recently, FaceFusion has gained popularity, and many websites now use [FaceFusion](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion) for face swapping.
FaceFusion is an updated version of Roop. Roop originally gained popularity as a user-friendly, one-click face-swapping tool, particularly in the context of Stable Diffusion extensions. Over time, it evolved and published FaceFusion, integrating new features and improvements based on the foundational work of Roop.
## Deepswap AI vs Facefusion
Since Deepswap claims to use a private model, let's make a comparison to see how it differs from Facefusion, which is an open-source face swapping software used by many websites.
### Face Swap Images
Let's start by conducting a face swap test with images. (All images are from Freepik)
1) Full Face
Input: 4912x7360px / JPG
Output:

7) Obstructions
Input: 3648x5472px / JPG
Output:

By comparing the face swap results of the different images above, we can see that Deepswap produces different results compared to Facefusion. Moreover, Deepswap shows better performance in handling occlusions, eyebrows, eyes, skin colors, and other details.
Which one do you prefer? Different people may have different preferences. However, in the face swap results above, Deepswap shows a higher degree of similarity.
### Face Swap Videos
Face swapping in videos is challenging for the following reasons:
1. Facial Movements and Expressions
   - Dynamic Expressions: Faces constantly change expressions, making accurate transfer crucial.
2. Lighting and Shadows
   - Changing Lighting: Videos have varying lighting conditions, complicating face matching.
   - Shadows: Adjusting shadows that shift with face movements is necessary.
3. Angles and Perspectives
   - Head Movements: Faces move in different directions, making alignment tricky.
   - Perspective Changes: Various angles affect facial features' appearance.
4. Temporal Consistency
   - Consistency Across Frames: Ensuring the face swap looks consistent in every frame is essential.
   - Motion Blur: Accurately handling motion blur caused by rapid movements is necessary.
5. Occlusions
   - Obstructions: Faces may be partly covered by hair or hands, making swaps complex.
   - Complex Backgrounds: Interactions with background elements add to the complexity.
6. Real-Time Processing
   - Performance: Achieving high-quality face swaps in real-time demands significant computational power.
7.Technological Challenges
- Model Complexity: Advanced techniques like GANs are needed to create models that address these challenges.
- Data Requirements: Training these models necessitates extensive and diverse datasets.
**Therefore, in some complex face swapping scenarios, the face swapping results may not be perfect.**
